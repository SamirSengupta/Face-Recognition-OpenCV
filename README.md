# Face Recognition using OpenCV

This project utilizes OpenCV for performing face recognition using deep learning techniques. It employs the Facenet model for face detection and recognition.

## Installation

To use this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- Facenet PyTorch
- MTCNN

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn torch facenet-pytorch mtcnn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamirSengupta/Face-Recognition-OpenCV.git
cd Face-Recognition-OpenCV
```

2. Place your profile images in the `Profile` folder and gallery images in the `Gallery` folder.

3. Run the `Face_Recognition.ipynb` notebook.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform face recognition.

## Notes

- Adjust the similarity threshold as needed for better recognition accuracy.
- Ensure that the images in the `Profile` and `Gallery` folders are of good quality for better results.
